## Current Implementation Status

The app has been built with basic Material Design 3 components, but may not match your Figma design exactly.

## What I Need From You

To accurately implement your Figma design, please provide:

### 1. Design Tokens

**Colors:**
- Primary color (hex)
- Secondary color (hex)
- Accent colors

- Padding/margin system

**Components:**

## How to Provide Design Specs
